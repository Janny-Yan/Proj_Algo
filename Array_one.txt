Push Front
Given an array and an additional value, insert this value at the beginning of the array. Do this without using any built-in array methods.

var myArr = [2,4,dog,8,2,cat],
var x = 4,
	i = myArr.length;
while (i--> 0)
	myArr[i+1] = myArr[i];
myArr[0]=x;
console.log(myArr)//"2,3,dog,8,2,cat,4"


Pop Front
Given an array, remove and return the value at the beginning of the array. Do this without using any built-in array methods except pop().

var myArr = [2,4,dog,8,2,cat],
var x = myArr[0],
i = myArr.length;
while (i--> 0)
	myArr[i] = myArr[i+1];
myArr.pop()
console.log(x)//"2"


Insert At
Given an array, index, and additional value, insert the value into array at given index. Do this without using built-in array methods. You can think of pushFront(arr,val) as equivalent to insertAt(arr,0,val).

var myArr = [2,4,dog,8,2,cat],
var x = 4,
myArr[myArr.length+1] = x
